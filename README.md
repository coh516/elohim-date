# elohim-date

Genesis 9:4 Any significant life that died is unclean for food.  Therefore flesh with its soul, its blood, you shall not eat.

convert the date to Elohim date as per the vegan oath (genesis 1:29, 1:30), with leap year and leap week every 4 years

dates are based on sun angles

year is calculated from the first word: beretset, of the 4'th quadrature of 12000 year segments in 1980, counting back from year 0
this is calculated from the aleph set (200-2)x10 and yud functions (300x400)/10 on the number values of the letters, however the book was written in the 3'rd set, shin of tav. 

the first day of the year is based on an approximation of 10 and half months, where each month is 30 days, according to Genesis 8:3, and Genesis 8:13, the new year begins 10 and half months after January, where there are 10 months in a year.  So the first day of the year is January 15.

months are based on the perfection of YHWH, the golden ratio * cos(72) = 1/2
they oscillate between 36 and 37 days for 10 months a year.

weeks are based on the approximation of 10 day weeks as segments of a 4 week month,

week number and days of week begin on day 1, and end on day 10, however the month and day of month begins on day 0.

the weekend is constructed from 6.5'th day of the week, per the evaluation of 40/36.525, taking from the last quadrature.  It is so because 40 is an approximation of a month, and 400 is an approximation of the year, per the motif of 40 days and 40 nights. 

biblical leap years added 2 days every 8 years to avoid injuries from breaking the vegan oath with 2 11 day leap weeks, as well as sacrificing the first born. (genesis 29:27)

In conclusion, no no crazy cult holidays are needed when animals are not killed or enslaved for food, textile or technology.

## Todo: 
    - leap weeks (one 11 day week per year in the middle of the year)
    - quadrature segment 
    - web component output
    - unit tests
