# The torah cipher story of how 0 turns into 1.

# After it began:

Genesis 1:11 And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, seed yielding herbs and fruit trees producing fruit according to its kind in which its seed is found, on the earth," and it was so.

Genesis 1:12 And the earth gave forth vegetation, seed yielding herbs according to its kind, and trees producing fruit, in which its seed is found, according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.

Genesis 1:30 And to all the beasts of the earth and to all the fowl of the heavens, and to everything that moves upon the earth, in which there is a living spirit, every green herb to eat," and it was so.

# Now that it has begun:

Convert the date to Elohim date, with leap year and leap week every 4 years, with leap year and week at end of year (last week of year has 11 days)

Dates are based on sun angles

Year is calculated from the first word: beretset, of the 4'th quadrature of 12000 year segments in 1980, counting back from year 0
this is calculated from the aleph set (200-2)x10 and yud functions (300x400)/10 on the number values of the letters, however the book was written in the 3'rd set, shin of tav.

the first day of the year is based on an approximation of 10 and half months, where each month is 30 days, according to Genesis 8:3, and Genesis 8:13, the new year begins 10 and half months after January, where there are 10 months in a year. So the first day of the year is January 15.

Months are based on the perfection of YHWH, the golden ratio \* cos(72) = 1/2. They oscillate between 36 and 37 days for 10 months a year.

Weeks are based on the approximation of 10 day weeks as segments of a 4 week month,

Week number and days of week begin on day 1, and end on day 10, however the month and day of month begins on day 0.

The year calculation has two components: the year beginning on January 15 and the year beginning on the month #7 (the 8'th month). The year is incremented civil since sufficient amount has passed by to say we are in this year.

Hours are 10 hours. The first hour is 1:00 and the last hour is 11:00. Instead of turning into 11:01 it turns into 1:01. There is an oscillating millisecond leap year that takes place every 25 years. The first millisecond, time incremented both up and down at the same time. Since it is known that this pattern exists, it no longer exists and it will only increment now.
