# elohim-date
convert the date to Elohim date as per the vegan oath, with leap year and leap week every 4 years

dates are based on sun angles

year is calculated from the first word: beretset, of the 4'th quadrature of 12000 year segments in 1980, counting back from year 0
this is calculated from the aleph set (200-2)*10 and yud functions (300*400)/10 on the number values of the letters, however the book was written in the 3'rd set, shin of tav. 

the first day of the year is based on an aproximation of 10 and half months, where each month is 30 days, according to Genesis 8:3, and Genesis 8:13, the new year begins 10 and half months after January, where there are 10 months in a year.  So the first day of the year is January 15.

months are based on the perfection of YHWH, the golden ratio * cos(72) = 1/2

weeks are based on the aproximation of 10 day weeks as segments of a 4 week month,

biblical leap years added 2 days every 8 years to avoid injuries from breaking the vegan oath with 2 11 day leap weeks (genesis 29:27)
