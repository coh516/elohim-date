# elohim-date

For those that fear God and uphold the vegan oath of ELohim. Convert the date to Elohim date, with leap year and leap week every 4 years

Genesis 1:11 And God said, "Let the earth sprout vegetation, seed yielding herbs and fruit trees producing fruit according to its kind in which its seed is found, on the earth," and it was so.

Genesis 1:12 And the earth gave forth vegetation, seed yielding herbs according to its kind, and trees producing fruit, in which its seed is found, according to its kind, and God saw that it was good.

Genesis 1:29 And God said, "Behold, I have given you every seed bearing herb, which is upon the surface of the entire earth, and every tree that has seed bearing fruit; it will be yours for food.

Gensis 1:30 And to all the beasts of the earth and to all the fowl of the heavens, and to everything that moves upon the earth, in which there is a living spirit, every green herb to eat," and it was so.

Genesis 9:4 Any significant life that died is unclean for food.  Therefore flesh with its soul, its blood, you shall not eat.

1 Samuel 14:26 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people feared the oath.

dates are based on sun angles

year is calculated from the first word: beretset, of the 4'th quadrature of 12000 year segments in 1980, counting back from year 0
this is calculated from the aleph set (200-2)x10 and yud functions (300x400)/10 on the number values of the letters, however the book was written in the 3'rd set, shin of tav. 

the first day of the year is based on an approximation of 10 and half months, where each month is 30 days, according to Genesis 8:3, and Genesis 8:13, the new year begins 10 and half months after January, where there are 10 months in a year.  So the first day of the year is January 15.

months are based on the perfection of YHWH, the golden ratio * cos(72) = 1/2
they oscillate between 36 and 37 days for 10 months a year.

weeks are based on the approximation of 10 day weeks as segments of a 4 week month,

week number and days of week begin on day 1, and end on day 10, however the month and day of month begins on day 0.

the weekend is constructed from 6.5'th day of the week, per the evaluation of 40/36.525, taking from the last quadrature.  It is so because 40 is an approximation of a month, and 400 is an approximation of the year, per the motif of 40 days and 40 nights. 

biblical leap years added 2 days every 8 years to avoid injuries from breaking the vegan oath with 2 11 day leap weeks, as well as sacrificing the first born. (genesis 29:27)

In conclusion, no no crazy cult holidays are needed when animals are not killed or enslaved for food, textile or technology.

36000 years have been counted in the time since Elohim, the law of his ocean, had been recorded from the date 1980.
